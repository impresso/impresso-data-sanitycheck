# Data Sanity Check

List of things to check:
1. text
2. images




### For a collection:

#### detecting holes (absence of data)

***Years***   
first year - last year => theoretical number of years   
number of year folder  => real number of years   

***Months***  
Each year should have 12 months.

***Days***  
Depend on publication, not possible to check for now.

#### detecting holes (missing data)**

Many things.

Shall we pre-compute the overview, or have queries?

For Olive:
- check presence of pdf file per issue
- check presence of .zip per issue
