# Data Sanity Check

### Absence of data might be due to

External factors:

- the journal stopped to be published for some years/months/days
- publication periodicity

Preservation factors:

- paper copies were lost and never digitized
- digital copies were lost


### To check

***Text/Images***  
 
- for each text page, there should be a corresponding image
- for each article, there should be text

***Olive***   

- check the presence/absence of issue pdfs
- check the presence/absence of page pdfs
- check presence of .zip per issue
- if not tifs, check presence of png

### Mapping the coverage

In the DB, store information so as to be able to (among others):

- detect missing/absent years of a journal
- detect missing/absent months of a year
- detect missing/absent days of a month
